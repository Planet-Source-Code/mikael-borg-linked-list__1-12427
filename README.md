## Linked List


</div>

### Description

The linked list component is a component designed to use with objects

that you want to have in a list. Any component class implementing the

Item class in the LinkedList component can be added to the list.

Using the Link class in the LinkedList component you can add, count and

remove items from the list. There is also a SendMessage method with

which you can send messages to the items in the list. It is up to the

listed class what you want to do with the message.

The demonstration project comes with a implementation of animated circles.

The LinkedList component could be used as a sprite list of sprites in

a game or a tile map for scrolling backgrounds.
