The linked list component is a component designed to use with objects
that you want to have in a list. Any component class implementing the
Item class in the LinkedList component can be added to the list.
Using the Link class in the LinkedList component you can add, count and
remove items from the list. There is also a SendMessage method with 
which you can send messages to the items in the list. It is up to the
listed class what you want to do with the message.

The demonstration project comes with a implementation of animated circles.
The LinkedList component could be used as a sprite list of sprites in 
a game or a tile map for scrolling backgrounds.
